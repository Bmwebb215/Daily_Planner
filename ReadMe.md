# Daily Planner

As An employee with a busy work schedule I want to have a daily planner 
When the application is ran it will show the time an the date
I can input tasks on a time block between the hours of 9AM and 5PM
When an event is currently happening it will be highlighted in Red
When the event time has passed it will be highlighted in grey
When an event is at least 2 hours away it will be highlighted in green
As a user I can save the events to the planner by clicking on the button to the right of the block
